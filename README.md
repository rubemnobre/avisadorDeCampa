A project I did for school. It's basically an LED matrix to display how long until the next class and stuff.   
Made on the Arduino IDE and on VS17 (for some serial interfacing simplification).   
On Brazil, most "high schools" have all the students on a class and the teachers come to them, so this device would be on the front of the room and display what's the next subject and how long for it to start.
